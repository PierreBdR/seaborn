Font-handling should work better on systems without Arial installed. This is accomplished by adding the ``font.sans-serif`` field to the ``axes_style`` definition with Arial and Liberation Sans prepended to matplotlib defaults. The font family can also be set through the ``font`` keyword argument in :func:`set`.
